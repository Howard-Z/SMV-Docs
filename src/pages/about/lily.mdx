# Lily Jiang

Hi! My name is Lily and I'm a second year student at UCLA studying Neuroscience. Coding is fun sometimes.

I like to cook and *eat*. Give me food. I also like to play GTA V and Persona 5 Royal and watch movies.   
I love waiting in long ass lines for free movie screenings. I read books when I have spare brain cells.    
I also make art.

Mussels are so good.

Admire Mushroom, my guinea pig.
