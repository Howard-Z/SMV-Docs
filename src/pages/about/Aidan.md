# Aidan Jan

Hi, I am Aidan Jan, a fourth year computer science major at UCLA!  My interests in pure computer science are algorithms and computer theory, and I work on a lot of projects involving big data and data processing.  Hence why I joined the data acquisition team of SMV!  I am hoping to be able to contribute in understanding the nuances of how the vehicles perform.

Aside from writing software for this club, I am also involved in the Mouse Connectome Project at UCLA, a project focused on mapping all the neurons in a mouse brain and understanding how they interact with each other.  There, I primarily focus on image processing pipelines, involving three-dimensional channel registration and deconvolution (deblur) algorithms.
