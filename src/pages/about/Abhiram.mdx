## About Me
Hello, I'm Abhiram Voleti, a 1st year Pre-Mathematics of Computation major and a new developer for the data acquisition team.
I recently joined SMV because I think energy efficient cars are cool and I hope to contribute a lot to this team!
In my free time I like to watch and play soccer, lift weights, watch movies and shows, play 
video games, and chronically scroll Instagram reels.  

## Hobbies
As mentioned above, I love watching (and sometimes overanalyzing) movies and TV Shows. My favorite American movies are Black Panther, Inception, and Interstellar and my favorite
actor is Leonardo DiCaprio. My favorite TV Shows ever are Breaking Bad, Family Guy, and How I Met Your Mother. 

I grew up watching and playing soccer so I'm a huge fan of the sport. My favorite teams are FC Barcelona and Tottenham Hotspur. 

I like lifting weights and can bench 225 pounds. 

I also grew up playing many video games. My favorites include Brawl Stars, Pokemon, and Genshin Impact.
