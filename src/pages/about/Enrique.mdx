## About me!

Hello! I'm a 1st year transfer from Los Angeles Pierce College, and I'm majoring in Computer Science!
I enjoy running and playing video games such as Lobotomy Corporation, Library of Ruina, and Limbus Company (Please tell me if you play these, I'm looking for fellow PM fans!!).
I'm very excited to join the DAQ team and seeing what's in store for me!
