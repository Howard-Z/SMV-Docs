Hi! My name is Daphne, and I'm a second-year computer science major at UCLA. This is also my second year at SMV on the DAQ team.
I'm interested in all aspects of software engineering, including frontend, backend, and game development. 
I'm always looking to learn and grow as a programmer through the next big project.  

Outside of programming, I enjoy creating digital art and animation. 
I also want to improve my skills in 3D visualization, singing/composing/mixing music and tennis or badminton in the future.  

I'm looking forward to working with the DAQ team this year, and I can't wait to contribute to what's ahead!
